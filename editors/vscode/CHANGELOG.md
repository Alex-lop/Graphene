- The graph: boxes by state in the cockpit's words, sub-goals as bands, the goal at the right, forks fanning out
  with their model and the kept one marked, the auto header; a details pane with Add step after / under, Link
  to…, Edit, Drop, Accept, Tell; wheel zoom, drag pan, arrow keys.
- Commands: Show Plan Graph, Open Cockpit, Auto…, Run Ready Tasks, Stop, Accept, Accept All, Add Step…, Link…,

- A status bar item: `◆ 2 running · 1 needs you · $0.42`.

  every change is a graphene command run as the person, the agent marks taken out of the environment.
